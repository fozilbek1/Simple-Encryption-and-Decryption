# Simple-Encryption-and-Decryption
This Python program offers a straightforward method for encrypting and decrypting messages using a randomized key. The encryption process involves substituting each character in the original message with a corresponding character from a shuffled set of characters, creating a ciphered text. Conversely, decryption involves reversing this process to retrieve the original message from the ciphered text.

Features:

- Encryption: Convert plain text messages into ciphered text for secure communication.
- Decryption: Decrypt ciphered text to retrieve the original message.
- Randomized Key Generation: Automatically generates a randomized key for each encryption session, enhancing security.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and easy-to-use interface suitable for Python beginners.
